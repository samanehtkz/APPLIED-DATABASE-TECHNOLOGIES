## Project Summary
Our project will develop an intuitive dashboard powered by a SQL database that analyzes medical cost based on the location, provider, and service. This will utilize a dataset from Kaggle containing healthcare providers across different demographics to allow for target users to make informed data-driven business decisions.

The proposed location-based provider cost prediction dashboard is highly beneficial for optimizing costs and enhancing financial planning. By comparing provider costs across different locations, companies can select providers that offer the best value, thus improving budgeting efficiency. The dashboard will also contribute to strategic decision-making, guiding where to expand or reduce operations based on cost trends. Additionally, the analysis can give organizations an upper hand during contract negotiations with providers. Ultimately, this tool will provide key insights that enhance cost efficiency, enable better strategic planning, and strengthen negotiation capabilities.
